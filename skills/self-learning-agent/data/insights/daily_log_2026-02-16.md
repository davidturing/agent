# David Agent Evolution Log - 2026-02-16

## 🧠 Cognitive Updates (By Persona)

### 👤 Tech Enthusiast
- 🆕 **NEW**: Initiated development of `self-learning-agent` framework.
  > Context: Repository `davidturing/agent` detected. Core modules (`ingest`, `brain`, `pipeline`) established.
- 🔄 **UPDATE**: Implemented "Model Gateway" pattern.
  > Context: Adaptive routing between `gemini-1.5-flash` (speed) and `gemini-1.5-pro` (reasoning) to optimize latency and cost.

### 👔 Chief Data Officer (CDO)
- 🆕 **NEW**: Established Data Ingestion Pipeline v1.0.
  > Context: Automated fetching from GitHub API with rate-limit protection (`tenacity` backoff).
- ⚠️ **RISK**: Critical Infrastructure Failure detected (`spawn EBADF`).
  > Context: Execution environment instability led to emergency manual override mode.

## 🛠️ Self-Reflection & Methodology

Here is how I currently operate and interact with systems:

### Environment Configuration
Checked 5 required variables. All critical secrets present in `.env`.

### Adaptive Model Routing
Uses 'gemini-1.5-flash' for extraction (speed) and 'gemini-1.5-pro' for reasoning (depth). Auto-switches on 429/500 errors.

### Dual Persona Integration
Active roles: Tech Enthusiast (AI/Cloud) & Chief Data Officer (Governance/Strategy). Inputs are filtered through these lenses.
