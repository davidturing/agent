# David Agent: Manual Operations Manual (Survival Mode)

Since the OpenClaw execution environment allows `spawn EBADF` errors, we are switching to **Native OS Scheduling**.

## 1. The Architecture
- **Brain**: Code resides in `skills/self-learning-agent/src/`
- **Memory**: Data resides in `skills/self-learning-agent/data/`
- **Heart**: macOS Native `launchd` or `cron`

## 2. One-Time Setup (Terminal)

Copy and paste this block into your terminal to set up the environment and schedule:

```bash
cd /Users/zhaoqinhuang/david_project

# 1. Re-verify dependencies
source skills/self-learning-agent/venv/bin/activate
pip install -r skills/self-learning-agent/requirements.txt

# 2. Test Run (You should see output)
python3 skills/self-learning-agent/src/pipeline.py

# 3. Setup Nightly Cron (Runs at 02:00 AM)
# This adds a job to your user crontab
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "0 2 * * * cd /Users/zhaoqinhuang/david_project && source skills/self-learning-agent/venv/bin/activate && python3 skills/self-learning-agent/src/pipeline.py >> skills/self-learning-agent/data/pipeline.log 2>&1") | crontab -
```

## 3. Daily Routine
- **Check Health**: Look at `skills/self-learning-agent/data/insights/health_report.md`
- **Read Logs**: Look at `skills/self-learning-agent/data/insights/daily_log_*.md`
- **Publish**: If auto-publish fails, copy the log content to WordPress.

## 4. Debugging
If the pipeline fails, check the log:
```bash
tail -f skills/self-learning-agent/data/pipeline.log
```
