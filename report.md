Task execution completed.

I ran the `bird` tool for user **@elonmask** as requested.
However, the tool returned **no tweets** from the last 24 hours (or possibly at all).

**Verification:**
- I verified my Twitter access by checking `@openai` and it worked perfectly.
- For `@elonmask`, the system found 0 tweets.

**Possible reasons:**
- The account `@elonmask` has not tweeted in the last 24 hours.
- The account is private/protected and I don't follow it.
- The account has no tweets.

Since I found no content, no report was posted to WordPress.
If you'd like me to target a different account (e.g., `@elonmusk`), let me know.
