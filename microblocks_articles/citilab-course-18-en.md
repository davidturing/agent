### Controlling the Robot with Snap!

#### Communication from a web environment: Snap!

- As we have already seen in the previous unit, it is possible to communicate with the ED1 board through web requests (REST) ​​thanks to the fact that we can start a web server on it.

- The web browser is not the only one that can make this type of request, they can also be made from other applications.

- In this unit we will see how to control the robot from [Snap!](https://snap.berkeley.edu/).

#### Sending commands from Snap!

- Snap! is a block programming environment very similar to Scratch but which allows you to create more complex projects, thanks to the fact that it includes more advanced instructions than this one.

- One of these instructions, the url _ block,allows web requests to be made in the same way as if they were made through the browser bar.

 NOTE: for some reason it does not work in the Chrome browser and its derivatives, so it is recommended to use Firefox**.

##### Challenge 1: Control the robot with url blocks.

Solution to challenge 1

##### Challenge 2: Control the robot with the arrow keys on your keyboard.

Solution to challenge 1

- It is also possible to control the robot with another MicroBlocks compatible board that supports WiFi, using the http:// _ block from the Client HTTP library in the Network folder.

- We will learn simpler ways to connect with Snap! later.
