### Windshield Wiper

 Citilab ED1. For other boards, an additional adapter board is required.

#### Stepper motors

- Stepper motors are a type of motor that rotate by small steps in one direction or the other.

- Stepper motors are very precise and versatile, since they can move by precise angles as well as full-turns.For example, stepper motors are used in to move the print head in plotters and 3D printers.

- A popular and cost-effective model is the 28BYJ-48. It operates at 5 Volts and allows 512 steps per lap.

#### Operation of stepper motors

- These motors have several windings that are activated to achieve the rotary movement.

- For each winding there is a specific cable to activate it.

- To use them you need a specific driver circuit that applies the appropriate voltages.

- The Citilab ED1 board incorporates 2 outputs prepared for this type of motor.

- For other boards, an adapter is required, which it's connected to 4 digital outputs.

#### ED1 Stepper Motors Library

- To work with the 28BYJ-48 stepper motors you need to use the ED1 Stepper Motor library found in the Kits and Boards category.

- There are blocks to work with the 2 motors independently and a specific one to move the two motors at the same time.

- Note for advanced users: The set motor pin _ for motor _ to _ block is used to control the ED1's motors pins as extra digital pins.

##### Challenge 1: Make a wiper with the speed controlled by a potentiometer.
