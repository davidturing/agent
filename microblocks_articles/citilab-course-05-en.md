### Playing with LEDs

#### LEDs

- An LED (Light Emitting Diode) is a device that emits light when an electric current passes through.

- There are several types of LEDs, with different sizes and colors. There are even some that can light up with any color (RGB).

- There are also RGB LED strips that are widely used for home automation and lighting in public places.

#### Connecting the LED

 For all boards with digital and analog connections.

- Connecting the LED to the board is done in a similar way to the potentiometer, but in this case we will use the digital pins instead of the analog ones.

- The colors of the cables and pins must be respected, otherwise the LED will not light up.

- To test how it turns on and off, we will use the block set digital pin _ to _ from Pins category, while changing the state of the logic switch.

##### Challenge 1: try to create a program that makes the blinking effect (blink) with the LED

Solution to challenge 1

##### Challenge 2: Make the blinking effect faster or slower depending on the value read from the potentiometer

Solution to challenge 2

#### Brightness control

- MicroBlocks allows analog values ​​to be used on digital pins, so we can manipulate the level of light emitted by the LED.

- For this we will use the block set pin _ to _ that we will find in the Pins category.

- As the range of values ​​is the same for the inputs as for the analog outputs, we can insert the analog reading block directly inside the previous one.

##### Challenge 3: Make the LED turn on gradually, like a beacon or a visual alarm.

 Hint: Use a variable to control the brightness.
