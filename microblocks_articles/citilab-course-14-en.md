### Fantastic Robot

#### Fantastic Robot

- Citilab's Fantàstic robot was designed to work on robotics in primary education.

- The kit consists of an ED1 board, two servomotors and a detachable chassis. Assemble the robot following the instructions in the box!

#### Robot movement

- The block move motor 1 in _ and motor 2 in _ _ steps allows to move the motors simultaneously.

- By combining the clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation of the motors, the robot can move forward, backward or turn.

- With 512 steps the robot moves around the perimeter of the wheel. In the case of the Fantastic they are about 22 cm.

- To move 1 cm you need to make about 23 engine steps (approximately 512/22).

- To rotate the robot 1 degree it is necessary to take about 2 steps. This number depends on the distance between the wheels and their diameter.

##### Challenge 1: Control the robot with the directional buttons on the board.

Solution to challenge 1

#### ED1 Fantàstic library

To work in millimeters and degrees, you can use the Robots→ED1 Fantàstic library.

- For example, we can place a marker adapter and make the Fantàstic robot draw a classic LOGO spiral.

#### More about the Fantastic robot

- Assemble your own Fantàstic Robot
